//Use destructuring assignment to swap the values of a and b so that a receives the value stored in b, and b receives the value stored in a.
let a = 8, b = 6;
// Only change code below this line

[a, b] = [b, a];
//by making it an array and setting it equal to the inverse declaration you can swap the values.
